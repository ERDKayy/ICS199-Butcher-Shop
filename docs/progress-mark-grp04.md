## Comments:
### Wk. 3:
* Gantt looks good.
* Commit msgs are excellent.
* Branching and Merging looks good.
* Use Issue Tracker for ideas, bugs, discussions.

### Wk. 4:
* The Gantt is all about planning. Don't delete Resources used for tasks completed.
* Assign people to tasks in the future right away. It can always be adjusted.
* Commits look good.
* Use better names for branches. Although milestone-5 may reference your Gantt, it is better in this case to state what you are working on.
Same with documentation. Use something like andrew-updt-gantt. This way, a `git branch` will show everything being worked on at any given time.
* Issues looks good!
